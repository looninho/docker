# Parrot Anafi 4K simulation in Docker container

stuck with `firmwared.service` failed to start

## build
```
docker build -t parrot-anafi_4k:simulation .
```

## run
### init systemd 
```
xhost +local:docker
```

```
docker run -it --rm --privileged --gpus all -u root \

```

in the init process I get an assert error and an failed error:
```
...
[  OK  ] Reached target Local File Systems.
apparmor.service: Starting requested but asserts failed.

### run Sphinx
open a new terminal and connect to the container as `docker_user`:
```
docker exec -it -u docker_user anafi_4k bash
```

then try the proposed command gives me:
```
systemctl status firmwared.service
Ã— firmwared.service - Parrot products firmware loading daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/firmwared.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

```

start the service as sudo:
```
sudo systemctl start firmwared.service
```
launch the simulation cannot connect to `firmwared`:
```
